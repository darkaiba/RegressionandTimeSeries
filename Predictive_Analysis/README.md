Predictive Analysis with Time Series
==================

1. Generate the Fictitious Time Series Database
We will create a synthetic database with a date column and a value column. The values ​​will be generated from a function that combines seasonal and random trends.

2. Initial Data Exploration and Analysis
We will visualize the generated data and perform a basic analysis to understand the behavior of the time series.
The generated graph will show how the value of the series evolves over time, with a general upward trend, seasonal variations and random noise.

3. Preparing the Predictive Model
For predictive analysis, we will use a simple model such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), which is widely used in time series. This model is suitable for predicting future values ​​based on past data.

4. Model Evaluation
The ARIMA model was fitted to the training data and used past observations to predict future values ​​in the test set. The mean squared error (MSE) is calculated to assess the accuracy of the prediction.

If the MSE is low, it means that the model predictions are close to the actual values.

The resulting graph will show the original time series, the actual test values, and the model predictions, allowing a clear visualization of the model performance.
